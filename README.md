### Project Description
Analyze the presence and qualities of one set of coordinates around a second set of coordinates. Throughout the program code and this description, coordinate set 1
is referred to as 'outposts', and coordinate set 2 are referred to as 'scouts'. Per their names, this project concerns itself with the number, distance, qualities, and 
statistics of scouts around individual outposts. Each outpost is independent of one another, so there is no need to regard any overlap of outposts analysis. 

### Project Code and Implementation
The overall program is managed through the EnvironmentManager class. Initializing an EnvironmentManager class object is the first step when using this program. See 
the documentation for details. After creating the EnvironmentManager class object, functions can be called. Each function call adds to the function stack in the FunctionStack 
class.
